### CPSC 120
* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I was always curious about how the
    game Blackjack works. I was able to write functions for the first time
    that calculate the correct value of a Blackjack hand no matter how many
    Aces were dealt.
* lab 2
    The reason lab 02 is my favorite is because it introduces us to strings and how we use it so we can use it for other labs 
    further down the line as almost every lab uses string.
* lab 4
    The reason lab 4 is my favorite is because it uses numbers for teaspoons 
    and ounces to show how we need to make it accurate to have the right answer 
    and shows the importance of converting variables to other variables as it was used constantly in this lab.
